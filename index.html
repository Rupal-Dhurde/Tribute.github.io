        <p>Irrfan Khan was a remarkable individual who made a significant impact in their field. His value stems from some of his personal choices too. His regular downplaying of the importance of fame, for one. Or how he stands as a contemporary example of how Bollywood success needn't always be inherited. Or how about the fact that his excellence spanning years doesn't suffer the stain of a single controversy?.</p>
        
        <p>Irrfan Khan will always be remembered for their passion and dedication. Fame and greatness aside, he remained till the end a person who had the ability to laugh in the face of danger. Upon learning of his cancer diagnosis, he wrote, “Little did I know that my search for rare stories would make me find a rare disease.” This is rare humour from a person rarer still. This loss hurts, and it's only appropriate that we take refuge in a line from one of his own films: “I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.”.</p>
        
        <p>Let's take a trip down memory lane and revisit some of his best dialogues of Irrfan Khan:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Life Of Pi - “I suppose, in the end, the whole life becomes an act of letting go”</li>
            <li>D-Day - “Galtiyan bhi rishton ki tarah hoti hai... karni nahi padti, ho jati hai”</li>
            <li>Life In A Metro - “Ye sheher humein jitna deta hai, badle mein kahin zyada humse le lete hai”</li>
            <li>Paan Singh Tomar - “Janta ki raksha ki naukri hai tumhari....Chita pe roti sekne ki naahi"</li>
        </ul>
